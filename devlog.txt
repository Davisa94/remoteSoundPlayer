Thursday Sep2: The project start:
The goal is to have a server that can be called by a script run by a chatbot to play sound files on a stremers pc from a second managing PC running the chatbot.
The first technical defficencies that need to be overcome are learning parelelism in python and learning aysynchronous programming in python.
instead of adding sources for EVERY SINGLE FILE now the python script can be run in the sounds folder and it will wait for triggers to come in from the bot to play the correct sound.
because this is my first time doing so with python. I am going to write a few test functions
The first audio library had issues playing bestcry.mp3 I assume it is either an encoding issue or a length issue. trying a different audio lib since the first one cant open some files
after some investigation it was in issue with ffmpeg not being installed;
After much tinkering it seems that absolute paths works much more consistently than relative paths and so switching to that is the course I shall take.
There is an issue with the process looping
Start researching asyncio library and see if it can handle the needs of the application

Friday Sep3:
Project structure design:
Server running on OBS PC within folder containing sounds, accepts POST requests to play a sound and plays them <- bot runs a small script that sends off the post request when the sound is triggered.
For the MVP we are moving to a single python file without paralellism.
